# lai-libsite
Drupal 7 theme for GW Libraries. Based on earlier Libsite7 theme (gwu-libraries/Libsite-Theme)

# Configuration

Put the theme files in the ./sites/all/themes/libsite7b directory of the Drupal instance's home

Dependencies:

The theme has no dependencies, but to configure it as the GW Libraries website you will need:

* Custom Views (export from Test or Prod instance)
* Custom GW Modules: Catalog Pointer, Library Hours, Twitter Timeline, Events, Events Feed, Stemworks_Events, Connection String, and Insert (these are all in Github as separate repos or in the Drupal-Modules repo) and Remove Title (not yet in GitHub)
